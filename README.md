### Heterogeneity of the contemporary European welfare states - comparative analysis of classical and modern clustering methods

This repository contains codes for my student project. It is not meant to present the full analysis. Especially, it does not give a proper introduction to the subject, a literature review, nor does it discuss its results. If you have any questions, you can contact me.

The project was about exploring welfare states regimes in Europe based on Esping-Andersen's theory (1990) and subsequent papers using cluster analysis. Hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN were conducted to compare the results.
